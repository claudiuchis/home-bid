# home-bid
Web app for estate agents to collect bids from home buyers (proof-of-concept).

It's a project where I got to learn the following concepts/technologies:

1. Feature Injection + Impact Mapping for defining the project vision, business goals, capabilities, features and stories, and the dependencies between them.

2. BDD (Behaviour Driven Design) + TDD (Test Driven Design) to focus my coding time on what is really important (requirements), and to create the automation that will allow me to refactor the code later.

3. C# .Net Core, Entity Framework Core, Web API's, MVC, Multithreading (Async) programming, Postgresql.
