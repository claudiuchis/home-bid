# home-bid
Web app for estate agents to collect bids from home buyers (proof-of-concept).

It's a project for showcasing some of the cool concepts/technologies I used lately: 

1. Feature Injection + Impact Mapping for defining requirements (project vision, business goals, capabilities, features and stories, and the dependencies between them).

2. BDD (Behaviour Driven Design) + TDD (Test Driven Design) for writing up stories using the common (ubiquitous) language, and automating the end to end tests using the acceptance criteria defined in the stories.

3. C# .Net Core, Entity Framework Core, Web API's, MVC, Multithreading (Async) programming, Postgresql, Git.
